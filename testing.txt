It is better for you to go through this section after recalling ideas
on triangles, in particular, the chapters on properties of triangles
and congruence of triangles.
You know how triangles are classified based on sides or
angles and the following important properties concerning triangles:
(i) The exterior angle of a triangle is equal in measure to the
sum of interior opposite angles.
(ii) The total measure of the three angles of a triangle is 180°.
(iii) Sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater
than the length of the third side.
(iv) In any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of
hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two
sides.
In the chapter on ‘Congruence of Triangles’, we saw that a triangle can be drawn if any
one of the following sets of measurements are given:
(i) Three sides.
(ii) Two sides and the angle between them.
(iii) Two angles and the side between them.
(iv) The hypotenuse and a leg in the case of a right-angled triangle.
We will now attempt to use these ideas to construct triangles.
